# QUANTA

QUANTA is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform built on the Solana blockchain. Its core mission is to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) by prioritizing user security, trustworthiness, and accessibility. By integrating advanced security mechanisms such as KYC (Know Your Customer), CIBIL score verification, and on-chain user assessment, QUANTA ensures a safer and more transparent lending and borrowing experience. The platform introduces its native token, QUANTA, which will serve as the primary currency for lending, borrowing, and repayment transactions.

# Why SOLANA?

We picked Solana for QUANTA because it's super fast, has super low fees, and can handle a ton of transactions without breaking a sweat. Plus, itâ€™s perfect for adding cool security features like KYC and on-chain assessments without slowing things down. Ideal for a smooth, secure platform!

# How do we stand out from other lending platforms?

First of all in crypto, there are so many lending platforms but we don't have peer-to-peer lending platforms. What I meant to say is we have those primitive lending platform and they are performing really good but what we wanted to make is a legit peer-to-peer lending platform where a LENDER chooses who they want to lend, a BORROWER chooses how they want to borrow.

# Why are we really doing this?

We want to make crypto accessible to everyone who uses a basic android. There are too many lending platforms but there threshold for lening and borrowing is not really possible for everyone to lend/borrow. There is one more thing which is trust issues with lending platform so we have done **things** to achieve that trust:-

1. KYC
2. CIBIL score
3. On-chain assessment

# What's the plane for future!

To be really f**** honest I really want to build something that actually help users and the ecosystem, not to just impress some 5% of the audience. So, what we will do in future:-

1. Start evaluating our programs again and making them more secure!
2. Launching our own stable coin which will help users to handle liqudity to some extent!
3. And who knows what next idea strike so yeaaaaa..........
